Here we have few data points in csv format.
These files contains x,y co-ordinates and timestamp with accuracy captured
by gps sensor.

Also provided a sample python script which will read given csv file
and plot it using matplot.

Following should be our aim:<br>
1) Smoothing route.<br>
2) Avoiding inaccurate points.<br>
3) Calculate distance.<br>
4) Build route with minimum possible points.<br>
